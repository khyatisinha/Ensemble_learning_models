# Ensemble_learning_models
This is an exploration and the comparison of the performance of other machine learning models with the ensemble learning.

The different models are trained and their performance is compared and contrasted against the model trained using Ensemble techniques by taking the votes from each individual classifier and then averaging it out.

The ensemble model outperforms the other models with an accuracy of 91% on the validation set.

Different plots are made to compare the decision boundaries of all the models to evaluate the performance of each of the classifier on the entire dataset, the training dataset and the test dataset respectively.
